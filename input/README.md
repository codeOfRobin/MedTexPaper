# Polymer coated incision on Brain Blood Barrier
### Robin Malhotra(2012TT10951), Rohit Kumar(2012TT10953)

## Main Problem Being Addressed
The blood–brain barrier (BBB) is a highly selective permeability barrier that separates the circulating blood from the brain extracellular fluid (BECF) in the central nervous system (CNS). In the event of a glioblastoma, the drugs to be administered aren't able to pass through this barrier. This is because blood–brain barrier allows the passage of water, some gases, and lipid-soluble molecules by passive diffusion, as well as the selective transport of molecules such as glucose and amino acids that are crucial to neural function. Our product aims to provide an easy and effective method to open up the blood brain barrier for administration of drugs, yet close once injection is completed so as to avoid infections.
## Summary of the proposed invention
Using a laser, an incision will be created in the blood-brain barrier. This incision will then be lined with a 'smart polymer' that is Electroactive Polymer (EAP). Once the incision is lined, a reverse electric current is applied, causing the incision to open up further. Thus, chemotherapy drugs can be introduced in the brain. Once the first dose is completed, the incision is closed by application of a positive current, and later opened at will for later courses.
## Current Status
Recently, doctors in Washington University School of Medicine in St.Louis operated on patients with glioblastoma – the most common and aggressive type of brain cancer – underwent minimally invasive laser surgery to treat a recurrence of their tumors.“The laser treatment kept the blood-brain barrier open for four to six weeks, providing us with a therapeutic window of opportunity to deliver chemotherapy drugs to the patients,” said co-corresponding author Eric C. Leuthardt. This, however carries a risk of infections being carried directly to the brain, and therefore the patient is required to be kept in a sterile environment, preferably in an ICU. Note that this laser technique has less collateral damage than traditional chemotherapy, with less impact to the immune system.
## Manufacture and Usage
The polymer ring will be made out of EAPs(Electroactive polymers), similar to artificial muscles. On application of an induced current, there will be attraction forces and the ring will collapse on itself, causing the incision to close. Later, in order to administer a second course of drugs, the incision can be opened again by applying a reverse electric current. The energy for this, can come from an RF Source using an energy harvester(research on these are being proposed at FITT, IIT Delhi). Another proposed way to do this is to use a polymer that can swell/contract in the presence of a solution (something like shape memory polymers as discussed in class).

## Comparitive Benefits and Advantages

This approach gives us a lot of flexibility with respect to treatment. The patient need not be restricted to an ICU as the risk of infections is greatly reduced. Also, it carries all the advantages of the laser incision approach that have been tested(for example, less collateral damage to the patient immune system as drugs are restricted to the brain). Also, it is fairly feasible with current technology, save one requirement which is discussed below
## Limitations
One limitation that hampers the feasibility of this product is the application of the polymer ring on the incision. It may be prohibitively difficult to stick the ring to the edges of a laser incision. However, with advances in keyhole surgery, this may become easier
